--How to run the project-- 
Make sure you have npm installed on your computer 
Via terminal (or command line), make sure you are located within the git repo folder 'CSCI334' 
I have started a branch called 'develop' so you will need to switch to that branch 
Type the command git checkout develop 
Once you are on that branch, cd to client/covid19-app 
Type the command: npm install 
This will add all the external dependencies needed to run the app 
Once installation is complete, type the command: npm start 
This will open your browser at localhost:3000 by default 
Once everything has compiled, add '/login' at the end of the brower URL to see the sample login page I have created
