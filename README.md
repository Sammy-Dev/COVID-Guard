--How to clone this repo-- <br />
Make sure you have git installed on your computer <br />
Create a new directory <br />
cd to that directory and type the command: git clone https://github.com/steamedHams11/CSCI334.git <br />
<br />
--How to run the project-- <br />
Make sure you have npm installed on your computer <br />
Via terminal (or command line), make sure you are located within the git repo folder 'CSCI334' <br />
I have started a branch called 'develop' so you will need to switch to that branch <br />
Type the command git checkout develop <br />
Once you are on that branch, cd to client/covid19-app <br />
Type the command: npm install <br />
This will add all the external dependencies needed to run the app <br />
Once installation is complete, type the command: npm start <br />
This will open your browser at localhost:3000 by default <br />
Once everything has compiled, add '/login' at the end of the brower URL to see the sample login page I have created <br />
